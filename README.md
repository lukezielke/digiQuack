# WARNING: Work in Progress

i am currently trying to update the JavaScript version of digiQuak because i noticed some bugs. Also i will (maybe) write a Go/Python program as a replacement for the old C++ program.

# digiQuack

digiQuack is an easy DuckyScript to DigiSpark payload converter based on JavaScript. It contains various features including full DuckyScript language support, execution limiter, DigiSpark memory optimizations and more. Note though that currently support of foreign keyboard layouts (not english ones) is rather spotty, so try it out and see if it works out for yourself. The code is well documented with comments so feel free to take a look for yourself.
